# BasicCompiler-LLVMSwift
A work in progress project to make a basic compiler that takes in some source code(small grammar) and generates an executable. 

## Goals
1. Learn various stages of the compilation process by making basic versions of the sub-components - Lexer, Parser, Sema, LLVM IR Generator and other optimisations that can be explored.
2. To become more familiar with the LLVM environment. 
3. To learn different type inference algorithms - Hindley Milner Inference etc.
4. Better developer diagnostics - how Swift and other languages contribute to making this possible, their relative trade-offs and strengths etc.
5. Prototyping other explorations to see their respective impact and limitations.
